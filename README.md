# Docker image configuration for Overview

To allow running Overview on users local machine, we create Docker images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/overview). Each subdirectory contains a Dockerfile and any additional files needed for Docker Hub to automatically build an image for the component.

The `docker-build.sh` script can be used to build the images locally.
