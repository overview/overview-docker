# Docker image configuration for Overview

This repository is for managing Docker images. If you'd like to _use_ our Docker
images, you should be looking at the [overview-local
repository](https://github.com/overview/overview-local).

Run `docker-build.sh` to build the images locally. Then run `docker-push.sh` to
push them to Docker Hub.
